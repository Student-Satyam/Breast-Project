🧬 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor

A simple and interactive Streamlit web app built to predict whether a breast tumor is Benign (B) or Malignant (M) based on user-inputted medical features.
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

🚀 Features

🔍 Predicts whether a tumor is Benign or Malignant.

📊 Uses a pre-trained SVM model for accurate classification.

📈 Automatically scales inputs with a pre-fitted scaler.

💡 User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy input and clear output.
